                <h2 class="text-list-title">Here's a time line of Elon Musk life:</h2>
                <ul class="text-dates">
                    <li><strong>1971</strong> - Born in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa.</li>
                    <li><strong>1983</strong> - At the age of 12, Musk sold a simple game called "Blastar" to a computer magazine for $500. Musk described it as "a trivial game ... but better than Flappy Bird."</li>
                    <li><strong>1989</strong> - After graduating from high school, Musk moved to Canada with his mother Maye, his sister Tosca, and his brother Kimbal, and spent two years studying at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.</li>
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> - With his brother, Kimbal, Musk launched Zip2. A cluster of Silicon Valley investors helped to fund the company, which provided city travel guides to newspapers like The New York Times and Chicago Tribune.</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong> - He finished his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, earning degrees in physics and economics.</li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong> - While Zip2 got off the ground, Musk literally lived in the office and showered at a local YMCA. The hard work paid off when Compaq bought Zip2 in a deal worth $341 million in cash and stock, earning Musk $22 million.</li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong> - Musk next started X.com, an online banking company. He launched the company in 1999 using $10 million of the money he got from the Zip2 sale. About a year later, X.com merged with Confinity, a financial startup cofounded by Peter Thiel, to form PayPal.</li>
                    <li><strong>2002</strong> - He made another windfall when eBay bought PayPal. As PayPal's single biggest shareholder, he netted $165 million of the $1.5 billion price eBay paid.</li>
                    <li><strong>2002</strong> - Even before the PayPal sale, Musk was dreaming up his next move, including a wild plan to send mice or plants to Mars. Musk founded the company that would be known as Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, with $100 million of the money received from the PayPal sale. Musk's goal was to make spaceflight cheaper by a factor of 10.</li>
                    <li><strong>2004</strong> - Musk has also been keeping plenty busy here on Earth, particularly with Tesla Motors. Musk made the first of what would be $70 million of total investments in Tesla, an electric car company cofounded by veteran startup exec Martin Eberhard.</li>
                    <li><strong>2006</strong> - As if that wasn't enough, Musk came up with the idea for SolarCity, a solar energy company. Musk gave his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive the working capital to get SolarCity off the ground in 2006. (In late 2016, Tesla bought SolarCity in a $2.6 billion deal.)</li>
                    <li><strong>2008</strong> - But between SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, Musk nearly went broke. He describes 2008 as "the worst year of my life." Tesla kept losing money, and SpaceX was having trouble launching its Falcon 1 rocket. By 2009, Musk was living off personal loans just to survive.</li>
                    <li><strong>2008</strong> - Right around Christmas 2008, Musk got two pieces of good news: SpaceX had landed a $1.5 billion contract with NASA to deliver supplies into space, and Tesla finally found more outside investors.</li>
                    <li><strong>2016</strong> - the SpaceX Falcon 9 made the first successful ocean landing of a reusable orbital rocket.</li>
                    <li><strong>2020</strong> - Now, thanks to Tesla's stock surging in 2020, Musk is the seventh-richest person in the world with a net worth of $82.2 billion. Musk's wealth has surpassed Larry Page, Larry Ellison, and Sergey Brin, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.</li>

                        <h3 class="quote">"There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing."</h3>
